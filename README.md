<h1 align="center">Hello!(ä½ å¥½(nÉ™ hÉ”))!ðŸ‘‹, here is Seven Streams.</h1>

I'm a third-year undergraduate of [**ACM Honors Class**](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

As an undergraduate, I'm mainly interested in machine learning system, large language models and automata theory. Currently, I'm working closely with [Ubospica](https://github.com/ubospica) on the open-source project [XGrammar](https://github.com/mlc-ai/xgrammar). I enjoy coding, and helping others achieve their goals.
Besides coding, I also like playing drums, chess, and football.

### What's Seven Streams?
Changshu, a small city in east China, is my hometown. There is a poem that describes the city: *Seven streams flow seaward with winding grace; Half of the green hills merge into the city's embrace.* That's why I use this name.
