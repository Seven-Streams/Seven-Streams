<h1 align="center">Hello(你好(nə hɔ))!👋, here is Seven Streams.</h1>

I'm a third-year undergraduate of [**ACM Honors Class**](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

As an undergraduate, I'm mainly interested in machine learning systems and large language models. Currently, I'm working closely with [Ubospica](https://github.com/ubospica) on the open-source project [XGrammar](https://github.com/mlc-ai/xgrammar). I enjoy coding and helping others. Besides coding, I also enjoy playing drums, chess, and football.

### What's Seven Streams?
Changshu, a small city in eastern China, is my hometown. There is a poem that describes the city: *Seven streams flow seaward with winding grace; Half of the green hills merge into the city's embrace.* That's why I use this name.


### What's Yuchuan?
As a Chinese traditional custom, a person should adopt a courtesy name upon adulthood. Yuchuan is my courtesy name, and I use it in many places.


### Some Other Words

🎵 弥勒世果報 🎵

地球(ふし)ぬ姿(しがた) 変わる事(くとぅ)ねさみ

変わるむぬや 人(ふぃとぅ)ぬ心 人(ふぃとぅ)ぬ心

人(ふぃとぅ)とぅ人(ふぃとぅ)ぬ 争いや捨(し)てぃてぃ

世界(しけ)ぬ平和 真に想(うむ)い 歌てぃ願(にが)ら


地球的样子，不会变化，

变化着的东西呀，是人的心、人的心，

人和人之间，停止纷争吧，

唱着真心期盼世界和平的歌。

The appearance of the Earth does not change;

What changes are people’s hearts — people’s hearts.

May all conflict between people be cast away,

and with true longing for world peace,

We sing and pray.
